# Application of a circular linked list include:
# 
# Going around each playerâ€™s turn in a multiplayer game
# Managing the application life cycle of a given operating system
# Implementing a Fibonacci heap

# Can start traversing the list from any node. Also high chance of entering an infinite loop if the stopping
# condition is not nmentioned.
